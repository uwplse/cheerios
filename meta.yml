synopsis: Coq library for verified serialization

description: |-
  A formally verified serialization library for Coq
  which defines a typeclass for serializable types and instances
  for many standard library types.

  ## Building and installation instructions

  The easiest way to build and install the Cheerios Coq library is via [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
  opam install coq-cheerios
  ```

  To instead build and install manually, do:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/uwplse/cheerios.git
  cd cheerios
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
  make install
  ```

  To use serializable types in executable programs, code must be extracted
  to OCaml and linked with the Cheerios runtime library. The connection between
  the Coq definitions and the runtime library primitives is established in
  `ExtractOCamlCheeriosBasic.v` in the `extraction` directory, which must be
  imported before extraction of serializable types.

  To build and install the OCaml runtime library:
  ```shell
  opam pin add cheerios-runtime -k git https://github.com/uwplse/cheerios.git
  ```

  To compile the runtime library manually, go to the `runtime` directory
  and run `make` (requires [OCamlbuild](https://github.com/ocaml/ocamlbuild)).
